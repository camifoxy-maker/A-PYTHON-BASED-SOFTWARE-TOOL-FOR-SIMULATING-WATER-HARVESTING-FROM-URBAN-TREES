Urban trees offer a natural yet underused solution for stormwater management. This paper introduces RainwaterHarvestingApp, an open-source Python tool for simulating and optimizing tree-based rainwater harvesting systems. This software integrates 3D geometric modeling of canopy, branches, and trunk with discrete-time hydraulic calculations to estimate interception and evaluate inverted conical collectors. An optimization routine identifies design parameters achieving >90% collection efficiency, reducing runoff significantly. Interactive 2D/3D visualizations, hyetographs, and efficiency curves support intuitive analysis. A baseline case shows a 3.19 m optimized cone radius capturing 1.5985 m³ from 1.7671 m³ rainfall, improving efficiency by 34.9%. This tool advances resilient urban water strategies
